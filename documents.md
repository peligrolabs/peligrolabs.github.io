Here you will find all sorts of documentation pertaining to research, designs, and company information. Note that all documentation is living and is updated frequently. Video game and digital therapeutics design documents are version controlled having proper version tags. For documents that don't have version tags, please also note that they too are continually being iterated on and Peligro Labs' vision and culture may have already evolved by the time you read the documentation.

Documentation in its present form is simply the most recently crystalized and written down thought on the topic or subject. For more information, please see this company document: The Importance of Living Documentation in the Rapidly Advancing High Technology Sector.
